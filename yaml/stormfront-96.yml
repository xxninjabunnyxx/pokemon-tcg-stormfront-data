  text: If Dusknoir is your Active Pokémon and would be Knocked Out by damage from
    your opponent's attack, you may discard all cards attached to Dusknoir LV.X and
    put Dusknoir LV.X as a Stadium card into play instead of discarding it. This counts
    as Dusknoir being Knocked Out and your opponent takes a Prize card. As long as
    you have Dusknoir LV.X as a Stadium card in play, put 1 damage counter on each
    of your opponent's Pokémon between turns. If another Stadium card comes into play
    or Dusknoir LV.X is discarded by the effects of any attacks, Poké-Powers, Poké-Bodies,
    Trainer, or Supporter cards, return Dusknoir LV.X to your hand.
